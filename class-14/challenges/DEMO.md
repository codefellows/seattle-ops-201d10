## Demo Code

In your README file, you can use these anchor links (`#`) to connect each section's title to its corresponding content. For example, clicking on `[Installation](#installation)` would jump to the "Installation" section in your README. Make sure that the anchor link text matches the section's title, and use lowercase letters and hyphens to create the link.

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Project Title and Description](#project-title-and-description)
- [Badges](#badges)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)
- [Documentation](#documentation)
- [Support and Contact Information](#support-and-contact-information)
- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)
- [Project Roadmap](#project-roadmap)
- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](#frequently-asked-questions-faq)
- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Visuals](#visuals)
- [Changelog](#changelog)
```

### Alternatively...

If you have multiple files in the same repository you can create a table of contents that links to those files.

For example, assuming you have the following script files in your repository:

- `README.md`
- `install.sh` 
- `run.ps1` 
- `setup.bat` 

Here's how you can create a table of contents in the `README.md` file that links to these script files:

```markdown
## Table of Contents

- [Bash Install Script](install.sh)
- [Powershell Run Script](run.ps1)
- [Batch Setup Script](setup.bat)
```

In this example, clicking on the links will open the respective script files in your repository. Just ensure that the filenames and extensions match the actual files you have in your repository.

Remember that the filenames are case-sensitive, so ensure that the links match the actual filenames in your repository.
