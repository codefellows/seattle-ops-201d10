1. Lab & Ops Challenge

## Overview

Issue tracking systems are a useful way to manage and resolve a technical workload as part of routine service desk operations. This exercise will expose you to common Windows problems and challenge you to document the problems in the Spiceworks ticketing system.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we practiced using Git, GitHub, and VS Code to complete the first Ops Challenge.

**What are we focusing on today**:
In this class, we'll be using issue tracking systems to manage and resolve a technical workload as part of routine service desk operations.

**Where we're headed**:
The next class will introduce troubleshooting methodologies to help resolve problems in a systemic, strategic fashion as part of operations support efforts.

## Issue Tracking System

### Why
- Provide a centralized platform to log, track, and manage all kinds of issues - IT support requests, software bugs, system errors, or project tasks.
- Create a centralized approach which ensures that all issues are organized, documented and accessible in one place
- Facilitate efficient communication and collaboration among team members, support agents, and stakeholders.
- Empower IT teams to assign priorities to different issues based on their urgency and impact on business operations.
- Promote transparency in issue resolution through comments, updates and audit trails.
- Include features for generating reports and analyzing trends.
- Significantly improve customer satisfaction.
- Add value for project management, managing tasks, milestones, and project-related issues effectively.
- Assist in the allocation resources, monitoring progress, and tracking project performance using these systems

### What
- _______ is the process of managing and resolving technical issues and support requests from users, often involving help desk professionals.
- _______ is a specific issue tracking system or ticketing system, mentioned in the text.
- _______ is a software tool used to log, track, and manage various types of issues, often related to IT support, software bugs, or project tasks.
- _______ is a single location or system where information is stored and managed, promoting organization and accessibility.
- _______ is prioritizing issues based on how critical they are and their potential effects on business operations.
- _______ is a record of all actions and changes made in a system, often used for accountability and tracking.
- _______ are personal attributes and interpersonal skills that enhance communication, collaboration, and relationships.
- _______ are abilities to analyze, evaluate, and solve complex problems logically and systematically.
- _______ is a centralized resource where users can seek help and support for their technical issues.
- _______ is a facility or department that handles incoming and outgoing customer communications, often for support purposes.
- _______ is the IT Infrastructure Library; a set of practices for IT service management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of the business.
- _______ is a visual representation of a process or algorithm using symbols and arrows to illustrate the steps and decisions.

### How
- In a theoretical scenario, you will help Bob resolve the technical issues on his Windows 10 PC.
  - Repair the computer so that Bob can open an important report from his user profile on his desktop with Apache OpenOffice suite.
  - Create a shortcut to the Apache Word Processor on Bob's desktop.
  - Notify Bob of any changes made via Spiceworks.
- Complete a Spiceworks ticket from inception to resolution.

### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
- What challenges could arise from managing various types of issues without a centralized system?
- How might such systems enhance collaboration among team members and stakeholders?
- What are some instances where soft skills might be more valuable than technical knowledge?
- Can you provide an example of a technical problem that could be effectively tackled using a flow chart?
- Are there situations where flow charts might not be as effective?
- How might critical thinking complement technical knowledge when assessing a complex issue?
- How does accurate documentation impact future troubleshooting, knowledge sharing, and collaboration?
- Could you draw parallels between good documentation practices in technical support and other fields?
- How might effective knowledge management streamline the process of resolving similar issues in the future?
- Could you provide examples of how documentation and shared knowledge contribute to organizational learning?
- What factors could influence the decision-making process for assigning resources to different tasks?
