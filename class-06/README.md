## Overview

Windows administrators should be aware of several key tools: Windows Firewall, Windows Defender Antivirus, and Task Manager.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In previous class, students performed Windows command line tools and how to interact with a Linux Samba share.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be exploring security features in Windows, specifically Defender and Firewall, as well as looking at task management and basic networking

**Where we're headed**:
Next class, we'll learn about OS upgrades and how to use Powershell to establish remote access to Windows.

## Windows Security Center

### Why
- This topic is important because it focuses on crucial elements of Windows security that protect the system from various threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
- What problems are we facing that this concept will solve:
  - Increased cyber threats
    - As technology advances, cyber threats become more sophisticated and prevalent, necessitating robust security measures.
  - Vulnerabilities in the system
    - Windows systems are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
  - Inadequate knowledge
    - Many users are unaware of the security features available in Windows, leading to potential risks due to misconfigurations or lack of proper usage.

### What
- _______ is a centralized dashboard in Windows operating systems that provides information and controls for various security features and settings.
- _______ is a built-in Windows utility that allows users to monitor and manage running processes, system performance, and resource usage.
- _______ is an integrated antivirus solution in Windows that provides real-time protection against malware, viruses, spyware, and other threats.
- _______ is a security feature in Windows that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect the system from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

### How
- Learn how to use Task Manager to identify and manage processes, monitor system performance, and handle resource utilization issues.
- Explore the functionalities of Windows Defender Antivirus and how it detects, blocks, and removes malware and other threats.
- Understand how to configure and manage Windows Firewall to control network traffic and protect the system from external threats.

### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
- Imagine you've just purchased a new computer, and you're setting it up for the first time. What steps might you take to ensure your computer is secure? How might Windows Security Center fit into this process?
- Many people consider antivirus software a fundamental aspect of computer security. Why might some users prefer third-party antivirus solutions over the built-in Windows Defender? Are there situations where relying solely on Windows Defender could be sufficient?
- The term "firewall" can be a bit abstract. How would you explain the concept of a firewall to someone unfamiliar with computer security? In what ways might a firewall, as a part of Windows Security Center, contribute to a safer online experience?
- Windows Security Center not only focuses on external threats but also emphasizes the importance of keeping your operating system and software up to date. Why is this aspect crucial in maintaining security? Can you think of any real-life examples where outdated software could lead to vulnerabilities?
- Some users might find constant security notifications a bit overwhelming, while others might appreciate the vigilance. How do you think Microsoft strikes a balance between keeping users informed about potential security issues without causing undue alarm?
- Considering the rapid evolution of technology and the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats, how might Windows Security Center need to adapt to stay effective in the future? Can you envision any new features or approaches that could enhance its role in protecting users?
- Let's explore the role of user behavior in computer security. Even with advanced security tools, individuals can inadvertently compromise their own security through actions like downloading unknown files or clicking on suspicious links. How might Windows Security Center educate and empower users to make informed decisions that enhance their security posture?
