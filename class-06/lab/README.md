In a Windows 10 VM:
- Block Edge from displaying websites using Windows Defender Firewall
- Scan the EICAR test malware file with Microsoft Defender AV
- Stop a task with Task Manager

## Resources

- [EICAR anti-malware test file](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950){:target="_blank"}

### Part 1: Windows Defender Firewall

This lab is performed on your own Windows 10 VM.

> This is a good opportunity to import a new Windows 10 VM from the baseline OVA image you should have backed up.

- Using Windows Defender Firewall, configure this computer so that Microsoft Edge is not allowed to browse the internet. 
  > Take care not to confuse Microsoft Edge with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both web browsers ship with Windows 10. Internet Explorer, or IE, is the legacy web browsing app used in earlier versions of Windows. It can be identified with its signature light blue "e" logo.
   - Include a screenshot of Microsoft Edge failing to navigate to the [Code Fellows web site](https://www.codefellows.org/){:target="_blank"} or another website.
      > HINT: msedge.exe is located under "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge"
   - Describe the steps you took in Windows Defender Firewall to block Microsoft Edge
- Reverse the above so that Edge is allowed again.

### Part 2: Microsoft Defender

- On your lab PC, locate Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Make sure itâ€™s enabled.
- Attempt to download the [EICAR anti-malware test file](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950){:target="_blank"}
- Include a screenshot of warnings or security messages that appear when you attempt to download the EICAR test file.
- Describe what just took place, and what Microsoft Defender Antivirus did.
- In Microsoft Defender Antivirus, perform a "Quick Scan."
- Include a screenshot of the "Quick Scan" in progress.

### Part 3: Task Manager

- Open Task Manager. 
- View running processes via Task Manager in the detailed view > Processes tab.
- Sort by processes that are consuming the most RAM.
  - Include a screenshot of the detailed view sorted by most RAM consumed.
- In Processes tab, locate Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) and End Task.
  - Describe what happened to the task bar when you stopped Windows Explorer.
- Start Windows Explorer (explorer.exe) from Task Manager.
  - Describe what was restored. How were all taskbar program icons restored? What does this tell you about explorer.exe?

## Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)

- Keeping the Performance monitor open in Task Manager, open a new program like a web browser.
  - Describe what you observe on the CPU utilization monitor. Why is this happening when you open a program?
- Open additional programs in Windows.
  - Describe What happens to the Memory indicator. What physical component does this map to?
- Keeping the Ethernet monitor open, navigate a web browser to YouTube.com and start watching a video in HD.
  - Describe what happens to Ethernet performance indicator. Why?
