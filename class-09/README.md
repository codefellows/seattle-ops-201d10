## Overview

Email account provisioning and client deployment are a routine operation in an internal service desk, but an important one. Following policy and SOP during employee onboarding, job transfer, and termination is critical to all parties involved.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class swe worked in the Registry and Event Viewer to get a hands-on feel of the core Windows configuration components

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be creating a reasonable and repeatable process for setting up workstations in a corporate environment.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on imaging, backups, and recovery methodologies.

## Workstation Deployment SOP

### Why
- An SOP ensures that all workstations are set up in a consistent and uniform manner. It defines a step-by-step process that needs to be followed every time a new workstation is deployed, minimizing variations and reducing the likelihood of errors.
- By having a well-defined SOP, the workstation deployment process becomes more efficient. IT teams can follow the documented procedures, saving time and effort, as they do not have to figure out the setup process from scratch each time.
- Standardizing workstation deployment ensures that all employees have access to the same software, configurations, security settings, and updates. This helps create a level playing field for all users, ensuring that everyone has the necessary tools and resources to perform their jobs effectively.
- A robust SOP addresses security concerns during workstation deployment. It outlines security measures, such as installing the latest patches, setting up firewall rules, and configuring antivirus software, to minimize potential vulnerabilities.
- In certain industries, there may be regulatory requirements or company policies related to workstation setup and data security. An SOP helps ensure that the organization stays compliant with these regulations and policies.
- With a well-documented SOP, IT teams can troubleshoot and resolve issues more efficiently during the deployment process. This minimizes downtime for the employees and allows them to start working on their tasks faster.
- When new IT team members join the organization, having a comprehensive SOP in place helps them quickly understand the procedures and best practices for workstation deployment. This facilitates smooth onboarding and knowledge transfer.
- As the organization grows and more workstations need to be deployed, having a reliable SOP becomes even more critical. It ensures that the deployment process remains scalable without compromising on quality or security.
- A well-defined SOP often includes backup and disaster recovery procedures. This helps in ensuring data integrity and business continuity in case of hardware failures, natural disasters, or other unexpected events.
- An SOP acts as a repository of knowledge for the organization's IT team. It captures the collective expertise and best practices, ensuring that critical knowledge is not lost if an IT staff member leaves the organization.

### How
- Prepare a new VM for a company's new hire according to the company's requirements:
  - VM storage configuration
  - Windows user profile configuration
  - Second internal hard drive installed and accessible from a user's profile
  - Windows user management
    - Password-protected user profile
    - Password-protected administrator profile
  - Thunderbird client
  - Configure an automatic email signature for the new hire
  - RDP settings

### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
- What do you think are the key goals or objectives when it comes to deploying workstations within an organization? How might these goals differ based on the nature of the organization or its industry?
- When it comes to writing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for workstation deployment, what advantages do you think well-documented procedures bring to an organization? Can you envision any potential drawbacks or challenges in strictly following SOPs?
- SOPs are often designed to provide a consistent and standardized approach to tasks. However, technology and best practices evolve over time. How do you think organizations can strike a balance between adhering to established SOPs and incorporating new, potentially more efficient methods?
- Let's explore the human element in workstation deployment. What role might effective communication play during the deployment process? How could clear communication contribute to a smoother deployment experience and potentially mitigate common issues that arise?
- It's often said that "one size doesn't fit all." How might this adage apply to workstation deployment strategies? What factors would you consider when deciding whether to tailor deployment approaches to specific departments or teams within an organization?
- Collaboration between IT teams, HR, and other relevant departments is crucial during workstation deployment. Why do you think cross-departmental collaboration is important in this context? Can you envision any challenges that might arise from a lack of collaboration?
- Let's discuss the potential challenges of maintaining security and data privacy during workstation deployment. How might a strong understanding of cybersecurity principles influence the deployment process and the writing of SOPs? Can you think of scenarios where overlooking security could have serious consequences?
