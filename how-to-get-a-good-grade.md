Hey folks, I want to talk about points and grades and what all that means for you and how you spend your time.

None of you should ever need to worry about your grade in this class.

Here's how you do that:

1. Every assignment is a ratio of cost vs reward. It costs time, and returns points. Prioritize your time and effort accordingly.
Here's roughly how that broke down for me most days (your times may be different depending on your strengths/weaknesses):
- Lab: about 3 hours (sometimes less, sometimes a lot more) = 10 points, which comes out to about 3.5 points per hour of work.
- Code Challenge: about 1 hour = 5 points, so 5 points per hour.
- Reading: 10-30 minutes, so let's call it 20 minutes =  5 points, so 15 points per hour of work.
- Learning Journal: 10 minutes = 1 point, or 6 points per hour.

You can spend about 30 minutes doing your learning journal and your reading and get 6 points, about 1/4 of the total points available for the day (21 total points).

2. Spread your time around. It's better to do a little bit of each assignment than all of one.
If you get halfway through your lab and halfway through your coding challenge and do your reading and your journal, you'll probably get at least 14 out of 21 possible points for the day.
With my numbers, that would take me on average about 2.5 hours. So, 2.5 hours = 14 points.
Alternatively I could spend 3 whole hours to complete just the lab, which would be 3 hours = 10 points.
See what's going on there?

3. Submit something for everything, every time.
If an assignment is late, even if it's perfect, you lose 20%. You can never get that back, but you can correct and resubmit and on-time assignment for full points.
So if you submit a perfect lab at 12:01am(PST), you get 8/10 points.
But if it's late and your stuck halfway through and submit partial work at 11:59pm, then get some help (or just fresh, well slept eyes) then next day and then resubmit, you get 10/10 points.

Also, never submit something that says "I couldn't figure it out". That gets you a 0 and late mark, just as if you hadn't submitted anything.
If something doesn't work, you document it. Good documentation of failure will get you more points than bad documentation of success.

4. You can (and should) game the submission requirements.
This feels like cheating but it's not, I promise:
- Your lab, reading, and coding challenges all require a link to an external document where you've done your work.
- So long as the link is submitted by midnight, the work is considered on time.
- You can continue to modify the contents of your code on github or your lab google doc after you have submitted the link to canvas.
- (Your learning journal is an exception to this, since its text is submitted directly.)

So if it's 08:55am and you haven't done your reading yet, make your github notes page and submit the link, then do the reading and add your notes to the github page.

If you submit a link and I go to grade it and there's nothing there, I'm not going to be pissed with you and you're not going to be in trouble, I'll just mark it 0 and late, just as if you hadn't submitted anything.

5. Putting it all together/Take it one day at a time.
Here's how I recommend going about your day:
- Do your reading first, or even the day before or in the morning before class. It's about the day's subject matter, so reading it before class can give a real edge and make you seem really smart because you can answer questions.
- Start your lab. It has a poor ratio of points to time, but it's also where you learn a lot. Sometimes labs are quick and easy and sometimes they turn into 6 hour epics. Get a good chunk of your lab done during lab time, while you still have access to your classmates, Marco, and myself.
- After a few hours of working on your lab, start your coding challenge. I find these easier than the labs but your mileage may vary. Same principle, though: you want to get a good start on this while you can still ask for help if you need it.
- Do your learning journal when you're done with everything else or just before midnight, whichever comes first. It's a free point for spending a few minutes of self-reflection at the end of the day. Don't miss it.

Now this might all feel a little mercenary, like you're trying to game the system.

Well, you are. And you should.

This course is like drinking from a firehose: it never stops, and you'll never get it all. After it's all over, no one will ever know or care what grade you got. They will only care what you know and what you can do, and learning to prioritize your effort when there's always more work than time is one of the most valuable skills you can have.

I don't want any of you to stress about grades. I want you to spend you energy being curious and creative and effective.
